# Vending-Machine-Controller
This project implements a Verilog-based vending machine controller, featuring an FSM architecture for handling coin detection, product selection, and change dispensing. The design supports multiple coin denominations and product options, ensuring correct vending logic and user interaction. The system includes error handling for invalid coins and timeouts, along with optimized state transitions for efficient operation. The design was simulated and verified using ModelSim/Vivado with comprehensive testbenches and modular design practices.
